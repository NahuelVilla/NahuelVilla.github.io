Hi, I’m Nahuel, a roboticist currently leading the locomotion team of [Nio Robotics](https://www.nio-robotics.com/), where I develop advanced controllers for Aru. 

I earned my mechanical engineering degree at the Argentina’s prestigious [Instituto Balseiro](https://www.ib.edu.ar/), which gave me a strong basis on physics, mathematics, and their application on the real world. Thanks to an academic exchange with [PHELMA](https://phelma.grenoble-inp.fr/) at the [Université Grenoble-Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), I dived into the legged robot control and decided to focus my PhD on robust control strategies for the locomotion of legged robots at [Inria-Grenoble](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-grenoble-alpes). 

Later, as a postdoc in the [Gepetto team](https://www.laas.fr/fr/equipes/gepetto/) of [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/en/), I took on the challenge of transforming the mobility of Talos. This involved designing a complete controller composed of a dynamic walking gait generator, task space whole-body controller and modelling of the hip flexibility that is characteristic of this platform. Talos is now capable of dynamic walking. I also had the rewarding opportunity to mentor a young engineer in the control of quadruped robots based on the Solo12 platform.

My work blends rigorous physics, mathematics, and control theory to push the boundaries of what robots can do in unpredictable environments. Welcome to my page—here, I plan to share my research, projects, and insights into the exciting world of robotics.
